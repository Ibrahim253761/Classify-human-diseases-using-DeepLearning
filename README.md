### What is this project for? ###
The project is about diagnosing Pneumonia from X-ray images of lungs of a person using self laid convolutional neural network. The images were of size greater than 1000 pixels per dimension and the total dataset.

- The dataset contained 5000+ X-ray images, labelled as showing symptoms of Pnuemonia or not.
- The work includes pre-processing of data.
- Laying down a Deep Convolutional Neural Network from scratch.
- The model showed a recall of 95% and a precision of 80%.
  - In context of the problem statement, recall of the model plays a more crucial role for the successfull classifcation of images.
-The final model has been implemented after continous hyper parameter searches.
